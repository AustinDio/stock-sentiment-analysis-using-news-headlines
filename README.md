# Stock sentiment analysis using news headlines
I led a project that utilized sentiment analysis to predict stock market trends based on news headlines. We collected historical stock data and news articles, applying text analysis techniques to extract sentiment features. Combining these with traditional financial indicators, we employed machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. These models provided valuable insights into how news sentiment influences stock prices. Challenges included handling noisy text data and market noise. Future plans involve enhancing accuracy with deep learning and real-time prediction capabilities. This project showcases my data-driven decision-making and proficiency in predictive modeling for financial insights.
